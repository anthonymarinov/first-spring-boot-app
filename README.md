# my first spring boot app
I am building this app to learn of spring boot. As of now, I'm rebuilding my no framework ```vanilla-todo-app``` using a a frontend and backend framework.

**backend:** spring boot with maven, sqlite \
**frontend:** next.js with typescript

Yes its overkill, but I'm learning.
